### Rubbish cli tooth for dealing with annoying bluetooth issues, which is almost certainly of no use to anybody else.

Despite never owning any other microsoft hardware, I've been enjoying this mouse for a decent while now: 
![Microsoft Modern Mobile Mouse](./config/devil-spawn.jpg)

It's fairly compact, minimal, feels nice in ya hand, fairly affordable, etc. etc. etc.

**HOWEVER**, it seems to assign itself a new MAC address every time it pairs with a computer, which means my computers are left with a million orphaned versions of "Modern Mobile Mouse" listed under the paired devices from every time I switch between machines and later re-connect it.

I know this is a fairly common issue with various bluetooth devices across different operating systems, and there's probably a much simpler and smarter way to deal with this, but I figured it was about time I gave back to this world! And so I'm using this as an excuse to build a very crumby cli tool which, at best, might make my own day to day life easier (to a very negligable degree) but will probably never be of any use to anyone else ever.

<sub>*DISCLAIMER: It is also very likely that I will never get this to a state where it actually works, but hey, at least I wrote **one** whole test.*<sub>
